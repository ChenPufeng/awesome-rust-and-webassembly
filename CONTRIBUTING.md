# Contributing

Want to contribute to Awesome Rust and WebAssembly? Rock on! ðŸ¤˜

## Goal

We aim to list libraries, tools, projects, resources, etc that are useful to
many Rust and WebAssembly users, relatively stable, and reliable.

## How?

The easiest way is to go to
https://github.com/rustwasm/awesome-rust-and-webassembly/blob/master/README.md
and click on the "pen" icon in the upper right corner. Make the changes to the
file and follow the instructions to create a pull request!

If you want to add an entry to the `README.md` please consider this:

* [ ] Is the entry valuable to people trying to get things done with Rust and
      WebAssembly? Does it fit the stated goals above?

* [ ] Use this template for new entries:

      ```markdown
      * [YYY](https://github.com/XXX/YYY) [![](https://img.shields.io/crates/d/YYY.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/YYY) [![](https://api.travis-ci.org/XXX/YYY.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/XXX/YYY) â€” DESCRIPTION
      ```
* [ ] Keep entries in alphabetical ordering!

* [ ] For wasm applications and projects, the source must be available so people
      can learn from the project.
